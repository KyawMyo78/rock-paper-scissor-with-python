## 🎭 Emotion Detection

The AI can detect and respond to these emotions:

### 😊 Happy
- **Detection**: Upward mouth curve (smile)
- **Reactions**: Encouraging and positive responses

### 😢 Sad  
- **Detection**: Downward mouth curve (frown)
- **Reactions**: Comforting and supportive messages

### 😮 Surprised
- **Detection**: Wide eyes + raised eyebrows + open mouth + dropped lower lip
- **Reactions**: Excited and surprised commentary

### 😴 Sleepy
- **Detection**: Nearly closed eyes (low eye aspect ratio)
- **Reactions**: Playful tired-themed responses

### 😐 Neutral
- **Detection**: Default state when no strong emotion detected
- **Reactions**: Standard game responses

## 🤲 Hand Gestures

The game recognizes these hand gestures:

| Gesture | Description | Hand Position |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| ✊ **Rock** | Closed fist | All fingers down |
| ✋ **Paper** | Open palm | All fingers extended |
| ✌️ **Scissors** | Peace sign | Index and middle finger up |

## 🖥️ System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 7/10/11, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
- **RAM**: 4GB
- **Camera**: Any USB webcam or built-in camera
- **Python**: 3.7+

### Recommended Requirements  
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+
- **RAM**: 8GB or more
- **Camera**: HD webcam (720p or higher)
- **Python**: 3.8+

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for camera handling and image processing
- **MediaPipe**: Google's framework for hand and face landmark detection
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing (automatically installed with OpenCV)

### Camera Support
- **Resolution Testing**: Automatically tests resolutions from 1920x1080 down to 320x240
- **Multi-Camera**: Supports up to 5 cameras (indices 0-4)
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if preferred resolution isn't available

### Performance
- **FPS**: Typically 15-30 FPS depending on camera and system
- **Latency**: Near real-time gesture and emotion detection
- **Memory**: Approximately 200-400MB RAM usage

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
**Problem**: "No cameras found!"
- **Solution**: Check camera connections and permissions
- **Windows**: Ensure camera isn't being used by another application
- **macOS**: Grant camera permissions in System Preferences
- **Linux**: Install v4l-utils: `sudo apt install v4l-utils`

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Low FPS or laggy detection
- **Solution**: 
  - Close other camera applications
  - Use a lower resolution camera
  - Reduce background applications

### Detection Issues
**Problem**: Gestures or emotions not detected
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure good lighting
  - Position hands clearly in camera view
  - Make distinct facial expressions
  - Toggle landmarks (press 'L') to see detection points
